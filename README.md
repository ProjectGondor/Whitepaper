## Introduction

## Concept
Incentiviced community publishing utilizes cryptocurrency and blockchain concepts to instigate author collaboration in single published works. The primary function is the block tree design concept that uses three basic ideas to link multiple "blocks" into a narrative that can be branched into multiple narratives within the same subject. These three pieces of the concept are blocks, branching, and the incentive. Each block is similar to a page or chapter in a story with many blocks linked together forming an entire book. In your typical physical book page 1 leads to page 2 and eventually to page 500, the end. With branching the link between pages is not as linear. Similar to how development models utilizing git can fork the main branch at any point to create a testing branch, the narrative of a story can branch off from the end of page 1 linking directly to page 25. The incentive relies on cryptocurrency standards and implementation allowing for blocks to be sold and owned. All three of these functions combined allow for multiple writen works to naturally grow with an incentive that builds off of collaborating with authors that have come before.

Standard publishing model already have a firm understanding on how to break up written word into easily managable pieces. A block in the publishing context is no different than these concepts within standard publishing. A block can be anything within the written work that may cause a divergence within the narrative of that work. Examples of blocks might be as simple as a paragraph within a fictional choose your own adventure story or as complex as an entire section of a research paper.


However, with branching capabilites the linear nature of a physical book is broken. The link between page 1 and 2 are no longer as strong
